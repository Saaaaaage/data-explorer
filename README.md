Did you know that the beer brewed in Brooklyn has the highest average rating among the 5 boroughs? I didn't! Every dataset has a story to tell. If you twist it, turn it, and let the light hit it just right, it'll share that story with you. Data Explorer is a celebration of the search for that story; of diving headfirst into a dataset, armed only with a trusty analytical tool. So jump in! Play with this data and see if you can't find an interesting fact to fire off around the water cooler.


Data Explorer is built with JavaScript, D3, HTML and SCSS. The dynamic updates to the page are built out of pure DOM manipulation. You can check out the project [here](https://saaaaaage.github.io/data-explorer/).
